Here I list the titles and a link to the papers I am focusing on

1)	Sesion-based Recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks
		https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06939

2)	Improved Recurrent Neural Networks for Session-based Recommendations
		This paper is based on 1) and tries to improve on it
		https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08117

3)	Next Basket Recommendation with Neural Networks
		http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1441/recsys2015_poster15.pdf

4)	A Dynamic Recurrent Model for Next Basket Recommendation
		http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2914683

5)	Multi-Rate Deep Learning for Temporal Recommendation
		Suggests using multiple RNNs to capture long- and short-term user preferences
		http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2914726&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=682434336&CFTOKEN=60778266

6)	Context-aware Sequential Recommendation
		Explores benefits of feeding context information into RNN, in addition to clicks. Time 
		between clicks and place/time/etc..
