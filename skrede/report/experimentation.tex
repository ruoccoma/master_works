\chapter{Experimentation}
Short intro to my experimentation here

\section{Comparison of models}
- compare my own implementation to Hidasis
  - show differences in results(accuracy and runtime)
  - show show other differences (implementation, preprocessing of dataset)

\section{Using a feed-forward layer in the model}
I compared two different models on the Movielens-1M dataset, with and without a feed-forward layer. The first model had a smaller GRU-layer of 100 units followed by a feed-forward layer of about 3377 units (same size as input layer) and the output here was the output layer. The second model had no feed-forward layer, and only had a large GRU-layer of 3377 units, and the output from this layer became the final output vector. The two models are shown in figure \TODO{Create a figure that illustrates the two models}. 

The idea was that the feed-forward layer would not necessarily improve the results, however the GRU units are probably more computational expansive, so using a feed-forward layer with a smaller GRU layer would maybe speed up the training.

Both models were compared on the same training and test set, on a GTX Titan X.
