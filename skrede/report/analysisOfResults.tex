\chapter{Analysis of Results}
Short intro here.

\section{Comparison of models}
Explain that the differences in implementation and preprocessing of datasets probably is the reason behind the performance difference. 
The Movielens dataset is not a real dataset (?), it is generally a "worse" dataset, with less structure in the data. One problem with it is that many of the movie-ratings have the same timestamp, so the order of those are very random, and the timespan between ratings can be vary greatly, while in the yoochoose dataset, the sequences have a much shorter timespan, meaning that the clicks are much more relevant to each other.

\section{Using a feed-forward layer in the model}
