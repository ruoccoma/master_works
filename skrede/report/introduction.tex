\chapter{Introduction}
Give short introduction about what this report will discuss (rnn), touch very briefly upon what the reader should have in mind and can expect from the report. Explain what will be discussed in the different chapters.

Touch very briefly upon what rnn is, so that the reader understands enough to understand the next sections, before we get to background. (Or should background come before motivation and objectives of work?)


\section{Motivation}
Why are RNNs interesting?
- easier feature extraction/engineering (zalando blog)
- the model fits very well with problems involving sequences. can model sequences, has memory
- has achieved very promising and state of the are results 
- has recently become interesting because of lstm, gru which helps with vanishing and exploding gradients, pluss powerful hardware
- does not suffer from cold-start problem. can apply on unknown users
- can easily work with sequences of different length

\section{Objectives of the work}
- look at work that has been done, state of the art
- look at how results can be improved when predicting sequences
- specifically interested in situations that apply to online users where we might have no prior knowledge of the user

\section{Background}
- explain the problem domain
- explain rnn
